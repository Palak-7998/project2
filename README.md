# Spam Mail Detection üìß

This project is a machine learning application that classifies emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam** using natural language processing techniques.  
It demonstrates the use of text preprocessing, feature extraction (TF-IDF), and classification models.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- Preprocesses raw email text (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal).  
- Converts text into numerical features using **TF-IDF vectorization**.  
- Classifies emails using **Logistic Regression**.  
- Achieves high accuracy on benchmark datasets.  
- Easy to extend with other ML models (Naive Bayes, SVM, etc.).

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn  
- **Algorithm**: TF-IDF + Logistic Regression
